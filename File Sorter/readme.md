This script streamlines file organization within a specified directory by automatically sorting files into folders based on their extensions. It scans a given directory, identifies unique file types, and dynamically creates appropriately named folders for each file type found (e.g., "pdf files" for .pdf files). The script then moves each file into its corresponding folder, ensuring a tidy and organized directory structure. This approach eliminates the need for manual sorting or hardcoding file types and folder names, offering a flexible and efficient solution for managing files. It's particularly useful for users looking to automate their digital file organization process, saving time and enhancing productivity.
